        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h3>Chapter 1</h3>

        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an<br>
             hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <br>
             <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific <br>
             journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed<br> 
             copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite<br>
              book since college, and the longer she spent in these<br> 
              four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>
            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting<br>
            under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming<br>
            that Work is the refuge of people who have nothing<br>
            better to do.
