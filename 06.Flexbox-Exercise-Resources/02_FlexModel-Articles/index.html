            <h2>The power of music</h2>
            <p>We can all think of at least one song that, when we hear it, triggers an emotional response.
                 It <br>might be a song that accompanied the first dance atyour wedding, for example, or a song that reminds you of a   
                 difficult break-up or the loss of a loved one.

            <h2>Reducing pain and anxiety</h2>
            <p>By analyzing 72 randomized<br> controlled trials involving more<br> than 7,000 patients who received <br>surgery, 
                researchers found those<br> who were played music after their<br> procedure reported feeling less pain and anxiety 
                than those who did not listen to music,
                and they were also less likely to need pain medication.

            <h2>An effective stress reliever</h2>
            <p>The study researchers, including Prof. Isabelle Peretz of the Center for Research on Brain,<br>
            Music and Language at the University of Montreal in<br> Canada, suggested the repetitive pattern of the music 
            the infants listened to reduced distress, possibly by <br>promoting "entrainment".
